seer.sh
=======

For developers and administrators who work with multiple Oracle databases, Seer is a shell script for UNIX machines that quickly runs queries and scripts with SQL*Plus. Unlike industrial tools and environments with up-front configurations, seer.sh takes options and arguments you provide from your favorite shell prompt and runs your queries in a consistent manner so you can generate reports, pipe the output to another command, save the results to a file or automate database administration tasks.
